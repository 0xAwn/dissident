# pocket
Protect your secrets - even if your password is leaked.

## Installation and Usage

To compile the program, simply run:

`~ >> go build ./pocket.go`

This will create a binary in the current directory called `pocket`.

Optionally for ease of use, you can then create a soft link to a directory that's in your path:

`~ >> ln -s /path/to/pocket /usr/bin/pocket`

This will allow you to call the program from anywhere with a simple:

`~ >> pocket`
